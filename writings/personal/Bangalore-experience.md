Life has been quite "not interesting" lately. I have tried to switch domains, places etc. Even forced many interactions with friends and Family, but doesn't matter what I do, I don't feel like anything is that interesting.

What can the possible reasons be ? Maybe after my father passed away, I really don't care about anything because at sometime I was doing it for my dad. Or, maybe it was a conjunction between what I like and what will help me and my family. It can be a lot of things, but the outcome is, I don't enjoy a lot of things.

Currently I am learning about Machine learning. Specifically AI. Actually at this point, it is not Machine learning, But, Deep learning. Deep learning is an interesting domain. It majorly revolves around Neurons. How can I make it better ? In the end, internet is needed for software access.
