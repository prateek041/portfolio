This is the base knowledge you need before you truly understand what is the use of tools like CFSSL here in "Kubernetes the hard way" :

# PKI (Public key infrastructure)

It is a back-end cybersecurity measure, a set of rules, policies and procedures needed to create, manage, distribute and revoke digital certificates and manage public-key encryption. It involves these primary blocks:

![19_06_12_Andreas_Authorising_Certificates_Blog_post.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669383907988/XCWcGzHcG.jpg align="left")

* Creation of certificate authority.
    
* Provisioning of certificates.
    

The certificate Authority is provisioned and initialized first. Then, any two systems that want to authenticate using TLS send the CA, a Certificate-signing-request (CSR), which gives them a TLS certificate that they can use to securely connect and communicate with other trusted services.

So, In very simple words, it is the infrastructure that emerged to help manage the encryption keys, binding them with a unique entity and creating a (verifiable) certificate, so that any user connecting to it can verify that it is the real entity.

If you understand all of what I said, you don't need to read anything written below, but if not, just get started and once you finish, re-read the above section.

## Security basics

![Client-server-model.svg.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669384238407/4-xwPDmKq.png align="left")

I will be considering the client-server architecture here because almost all the people are familiar with websites, clients etc. But the concepts explained here can be used for any two systems to communicate.

Let's consider two systems, they use a client-server architecture for communication. They can use a protocol like **HTTP** or another right? But why do all the websites (secure ones) you visit, via your internet have **HTTPS** and a "lock" icon in front of the URL?

That is because of many flaws present in bare HTTP (many other protocols), the biggest one is that it sends and receives the data in **plain text**. Which means anyone who can gain access to it, can read it. Now imagine whatever you have to say (write) can be read by anyone. specifically, people who are bad enough to try to gain access to it in the first place.

The necessary things to be present when two systems communicate are:

* Confidentiality - Only the one supposed to see the message should see it, no unauthorized access.
    
* Integrity - The message was not altered before it reached from client to server.
    
* Identification - Who is the one the client is talking to?
    
* Authentication - Is the server a real one? or they are impersonating someone else?
    

This gives rise to security and it has a long history and iteration, which of course I am not going to talk about, we will start with this.

## Confidentiality with cryptography

So the problem was that anybody could read messages right? let's just **encrypt** it with a key, so that even if they gain access to your messages, it's all just some gibberish that doesn't make sense. But how does the person you want to talk to, understand the message? it's gibberish for them too! We can use cryptography to solve the problem.

You can google what cryptography means or just check out "Caesar cipher" and you'll understand. there are two ways:

### Single key / Symmetric Cryptography

![Symmetric-Encryption.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669383956441/DXu2q-6th.png align="left")

So, the data that the client wants to send to the Server is now going to be *encrypted* with a *Key*. The server can use that key to *decrypt* the messages i.e. **SINGLE KEY FOR BOTH, ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION**.

This also has many problems, How will the client provide the key to the server? and what if the key itself is stolen and the bad person (hacker) makes a copy of it? They can also use the same key to read client's secret messages! what was the point of the whole encrypting thing anyway then? So, we have a better way, the *Asymmetric key encryption* that solves the problem of sharing keys.

### Public key / Asymmetric Cryptography:

![Asymmetric cryptography](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669383999443/jUAflbS--.png align="left")

This process uses **Mathematics**, but all you need to know is that there are two keys (instead of one) and they are mathematically connected in a way that, data can be encrypted with one key and decrypted only by the other i.e. **ONE KEY FOR ENCRYPTION, ANOTHER FOR DECRYPTION**. The key pair is called a public-private key pair, one property is that you cannot derive *private key* from a *public key* but the reverse is possible.

So, the client uses the Private key to decrypt the messages and the server uses the public key for the encryption. here is an example:

**The client wants to send a message to the server:**

* It uses the server's public key which is openly available, to encrypt the message and send it to the server. Only the private key can decrypt the message and is kept very safe and hidden.

**The server wants to send a message to the client:**

* The server uses the client's public key to encrypt the message and send to the client, only the client's private key can decrypt the message now.

The biggest upside is, the public key is openly available and can be used by anyone to encrypt the message, before sending it to the receiver.

What is the downside? **Asymmetric encryption is slow in comparison to Symmetric encryption**. So, remember this flaw, we will address it later :D

## Integrity with Message Digests

A message digest is a fixed number of characters that is Unique, it is a numeric representation of the contents of the messages.

![message-digest.webp](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669364747420/1VDeGndRy.webp align="left")

As you know the size of the message can increase or decrease depending on the sender, but message digest is unique because it is created by transforming the content of a message (of changing size) into a numeric representation (of fixed size) using a hashing algorithm. The hash created has two properties:

* It is not reversible i.e. It is impossible to convert the numeric representation back to the message again.

* No two messages can have the same digest. i.e. the digest is unique.

Now you might be wondering, how does integrity come in here?

### How it happens

Any message that a client sends to the server to communicate, contains the following things:

```graphql
message: {
  encryptedMessage: aefasdjkfhaiepwuhr234ih235345kj23kjdsdajkhasd,
  messageDigest: "FD34 7HD6 SD7A 3454 ...",
  hashingFunction: "sha256"
}
```

The above code is just an example, but it contains:

* The encrypted message (encrypted with the receiver's public key).

* The message digest

* The hashing function is used to create the message digest.

Now, on receiving the message, only the server can decrypt it because it was signed by its public key, hence **Confidentiality**. After decrypting, the server uses the hashing function to convert the (decrypted) message into a message digest.

Now, the server compares the newly created message digest with the one that was created and passed by the client. If they both are the same, the message was not altered and it's all good hence, **Integrity**. Otherwise, something is wrong and someone was able to alter the message, maybe the keys are compromised.

## Identification

For a server to be connected to a client, it must be unique. That uniqueness is how the client/server will know whom they are talking to. This is comparatively easy to provide.

* Mail
* Organization Name
* Domain name etc.

All you need to know is the identification part can be implemented in many ways for different things. Eg: A server can identify a client based on the username/password combination. Maybe their email etc. but they just have to be unique to identify an entity in the system containing many.

In the above topics, we have achieved:

* **Confidentiality**, where we talked about using encryption to prevent unauthorized access.
* **Integrity**, where we talk about checking if the messages were changed using the message digests.
* **Identification** is about uniquely identifying someone.

## Authentication with Digital certificates

Certificates and the protocols used for verification have a long history. Starting from SSL to a world where it is deprecated and TSL is used but here are the basics.

### Basics

So, the client wants to talk to a server, server's public key is openly available so messages can be sent to it, but, what is the proof that there is no one impersonating that server, After all, there is no proof that the public key do belong to that server and not some random person, who put their public key in place of server's. This "trust" or "assurance" is given by the digital certificates.

![veracode-appsec_man-middle-attack.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669365229747/ABnfjLHSZ.png align="left")

### What is a certificate

A certificate is a way of binding a unique **Identification** with a **public key**. It is created by **Certificate authorities** (CA). So, when the certificate is issued, it is the CA's way of vouching for the owner of the certificate, that they are who they are claiming to be. All the browsers who trust that CA, trust the certificate and hence trust the server.

* It helps in preventing man-in-the-middle attacks.
* It follows X.509 and contains the following information:
  * Owner's public key.
  * Owner's distinguished name.
  * CA's distinguished name.
  * Serial number, no two certificates signed by the same CA have the same serial number.
  * Current version of X.509 standard
  * Date of creation and expiration of Certificate.

![obtain-cert.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669365648257/Rf6AIdalG.gif align="left")

The organization that wants to be verified sends its unique identification and the public key to a CA, the request is called Certificate-signing-request (CSR), and the CA takes the info and verifies it. Eventually *Issues* a certificate by signing the information with it's private key. Now the organization is *trusted* and their certificate contains all the information needed to authenticate the server.

**Server's side**: Before a server starts serving traffic, it has to get a TLS/SSL certificate, that is signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). Once it is certified, its HTTP connection is secured and is now HTTPS. Now, all the connections with the client will be TLS-secured.

**Client's side**: Before connecting to any server, the client will check if the server has a TLS/SSL certificate. In other words, does it use HTTPS? if yes, only then will it try to connect to the server using **TLS Handshake**. Once the connection is established, they can start communicating.

Now, you might be wondering, how can we trust the CA? well, they have been through some rigorous security tests and have been around for a while. They are the first block in the *chain of trust*.

### Cryptographic protocols SSL/TLS

* These protocols enable two parties to identify and authenticate as well as communicate with data integrity and confidentiality.
* These protocols have two layers: Record protocol and Handshake protocol.
* It enables two parties to identify each other and share information with confidentiality.

### TLS record protocol

* It is responsible for confidentiality and data integrity

### TLS handshake (Handshake protocol)

Now, that the server is certified, TLS secured and ready to serve the traffic, all the client needs to do is *check* if the server is trusted, and has a real/valid TLS certificate and it can establish the connection with the server.

Today, any website or remote server, that is TLS secured and you try to connect to it, a TLS handshake takes place, it happens so fast that you might not even realize it, but it is there. It is there because it enables the connection between the client and server to be secure and fast. It leverages both Symmetric and Asymmetric cryptography hence, let's just see what it is.

#### What it is

* It is a negotiation between two parties on a network, they decide many things that are needed for proper communication between them.
* What version of TLS is going to be used?
* What is the cipher suite?
* Verifies the server (Authentication).
* Finally establishes a secure connection between the machines.

#### This is how it happens, a simple version

![1_24.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669365777533/Ovra_EbuF.png align="left")

* It starts with a **"Client Hello"** message, that contains the following information:
  * The TLS protocol version, supported by the client, and an order of preference.
  * The **cipher suites** that are supported by the client.
  * Some random byte (you will know why ? later).

* The server responds with a **"Server Hello"**, that contains the following information:
  * The selected Cipher suite and the TLS version.
  * A session ID.
  * It's digital certificate.
  * Some random bytes.
  * Also, if the server wants the client's certificate, it can make a "client certificate request"
* The client verifies the certificate (How ? It's below).
* Now the client and server do a **Key Exchange** to eventually produce a **shared secret**, which is insanely secure and start using that secret as a key for encrypting and decrypting (symmetric key cryptography) the messages so that they are fast and secured.

* [Network stack and the internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG9oKZdFb7w)

#### How are the certificates verified?

Since the certificate was signed using the CA's private key, it can be decrypted by the client using the CA's public key freely available online. The client decrypts the certificate to get out the information about the server. There is a lot of ground to cover here from the topics like "chain of trust", "root organization", "leaf organization" and whatnot which is not the scope of this article.

You can check more about online but here is something interesting for you. You can click on the "lock" icon present in front of the URL of any (secure) website and you will get to see it's certificate, the issuer's name, chain of trust etc.

The key takeaway here is that A certificate issued from a trusted authority is all that a web browser needs to trust the owner of the certificate and it is easy to verify the certificate.

TLS handshake leads to the creation of a TLS-secured session, where the shared-secret key is used for communication for a while until it is recreated (different from previous ones) when either it expires or the client establishes a new session by rejoining the connection. In both cases, a TLS handshake happens again.

This makes use of both public key cryptography (to exchange keys and create a shared secret) and symmetric key cryptography (for fast encryption and decryption of messages).

This is all the prerequisite knowledge we needed to get started with CFSSL and why was it used in Kubernetes the hard way. Go and read the first paragraph of this article now, You will surely understand what PKI is all about.

## What does CFSSL do?

* It can work as a certificate bundler as well as a lightweight Certificate Authority.

### How it works as a Bundler or, what even is a Bundler?

![image01_4.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669366367768/Kl21xU7NL.png align="left")

* In the most simple terms, whenever you see the TLS certificate of any trusted website, you'll see a chain, usually split between root, intermediate and leaf.
* The leaf certificate is what is owned by the owner of a website, and it is trusted by the authority above it, which itself is trusted by another. It is a chain, that traces back to the root authority, which self signs it's certificates.
* Why does the root issuer not have an issuer and is allowed to self-sign? well, this authority has been through some rigorous rigorous audits and they have been there for a while (the whole trust thing). So, eventually, we need someone to start the chain of trust, right? That is them.
* There can be one or many intermediate organizations signing the certificates and that is where the whole "managing the bundle" comes in. Why?
* For your browser to trust a server, it must trust the root authority. Different browsers support different root authorities!
* for example:
  * Firefox trusts 143 root certificates but Windows 8.1 trusts 391, Do you see the problem here? what if one of your customers uses Firefox and one uses Windows 8.1, if you choose the wrong root, one user might not be able to access your product.
  * Older systems don't even know about new root authorities, how will they trust them?
  * Older systems don't even support cryptography.
* So, there is this entire bundle of certificates that are connected in the form of a chain of trust. If you choose the wrong bundle, some users lose access to your service, how CFSSL solve this?
* CFSSL bundler has two flavors, the CLI and an API, but it is pretty simple, you just give them your certificate (API/CLI anyway) and it will the necessary information you need.
* If you want to create a bundle with CFSSL, then you have to tell them about your target audience (e.g.: who will visit your website) and the certificates their system trusts

#### CFSSL as a certificate Authority

![19_06_12_Andreas_Authorising_Certificates_Blog_post.jpg](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669366433644/BoXlH-KEp.jpg align="left")

* It does all that is needed for certificate creation, which includes creating a private key, building a CSR and eventually signing the certificates.
* So, if you want to build certificates on your own, use CFSSL as the CA, which will sign your certificates!

### Why is it used in Kubernetes the hard way?

![kubernetes-architecture-diagram-1.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1669383813312/oAdFq48rB.png align="left")

* Since Kubernetes itself is a distributed system, it contains many different components like an API server, Kube controller manager, Kube scheduler, Kube proxy etc. All of them are separate services and need to communicate with each other for the cluster to work. For security purposes, these services use TLS to communicate and follow the PKI infrastructure, therefore they need things like (trusted) TLS certificates and CA to provision them. CFSSL does that for us.
